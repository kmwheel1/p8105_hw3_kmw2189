## Problem 1

The Instacart dataset has 1384617 rows of data for 131209 distinct
orders. There were 39123 unique products ordered in this dataset, and
bananas are the most popular item with 18726 orders. The top 10 items
ordered are listed below **Plug Product Table Here**. 60% of the items
ordered were reorders **INSERT HIST HERE**. Last but not least, people
waited on on average 17.0661259 days to place this order after their
previous order.

**1A) How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
ordered from?**

There are 134 aisles at the Instacart warehouse. The most popular aisle
is Fresh Vegetables, and the top 5 aisles are listed below.

| aisle                      |  count |
| :------------------------- | -----: |
| fresh vegetables           | 150609 |
| fresh fruits               | 150473 |
| packaged vegetables fruits |  78493 |
| yogurt                     |  55240 |
| packaged cheese            |  41699 |

**1B) Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.**

**1C) Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.**

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 | count |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ----: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |   499 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |   387 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |   336 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |    30 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |    28 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |    26 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          |  9784 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           |  5546 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           |  4966 |

**1D) Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format
this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).**

| product\_name    |   Sun |   Mon |   Tue |   Wed |   Thu |   Fri |   Sat |
| :--------------- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

# Problem 2

format the data to use appropriate variable names; focus on the “Overall
Health” topic include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” organize
responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

    ## Multiple files in zip: reading 'Behavioral_Risk_Factors__Selected_Metropolitan_Area_Risk_Trends__SMART__County_Prevalence_Data__2010_and_prior_.csv'

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Sample_Size = col_double(),
    ##   Data_value = col_double(),
    ##   Confidence_limit_Low = col_double(),
    ##   Confidence_limit_High = col_double(),
    ##   Display_order = col_double(),
    ##   LocationID = col_logical()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

    ## Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 500 rows [4211,
    ## 4212, 4213, 4214, 4215, 4216, 4217, 4218, 4219, 4220, 4221, 4222, 4223,
    ## 4224, 4225, 4226, 4227, 4228, 4229, 4230, ...].

**2A) In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What
about in 2010?**

``` r
##brfss_data %>% 
  ##group_by(year, state, county) %>% 
  ##count (county)
  ##summarize n
```

**2B)Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic
will help).**

**2C) Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.**
