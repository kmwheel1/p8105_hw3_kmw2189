## Problem 1

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations.

**1A) How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
ordered from?**

There are 134 aisles at the Instacart warehouse. The most popular aisle
is Fresh Vegetables, and the top 5 aisles are listed below.

| aisle                      |  count |
| :------------------------- | -----: |
| fresh vegetables           | 150609 |
| fresh fruits               | 150473 |
| packaged vegetables fruits |  78493 |
| yogurt                     |  55240 |
| packaged cheese            |  41699 |

**1B) Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.**

**1C) Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.**

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 | count |

| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |   499 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |   387 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |   336 |

| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           |  4966 |

**1D) Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format
this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).**

| product\_name    |   Fri |   Mon |   Sat |   Sun |   Thu |   Tue |   Wed |
| :--------------- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: |
